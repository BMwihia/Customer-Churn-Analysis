    "###  Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to build a **machine learning classification model** to predict whether a customer will churn. Churn is defined as a customer discontinuing their service with the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn impacts company growth, customer acquisition costs, and revenue. Reducing churn through predictive analytics can help improve long-term profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Telecommunications companies often struggle with customer churn due to fierce competition, pricing wars, and service dissatisfaction. Retaining existing customers is **significantly more cost-effective** than acquiring new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing customer behavior and demographics, we aim to provide actionable insights that help the business:\n",
    "- Identify at-risk customers early\n",
    "- Understand the drivers of churn\n",
    "- Develop targeted retention strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Target Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Column Name:** `Churn`\n",
    "- **Type:** Binary classification\n",
    "- **Values:** `Yes` (Customer churned) or `No` (Customer retained)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Key Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What customer behaviors, demographics, or service usage patterns are linked to churn?\n",
    "2. Can we build a predictive model to flag customers likely to churn?\n",
    "3. Which features contribute most to customer retention or loss?\n",
    "4. How can the business leverage these insights to **proactively reduce churn**?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Technical**: A predictive model with strong recall, F1-score, and low false negatives (so we don’t miss churners).\n",
    "- **Business**: Insights are actionable and help reduce churn by **at least 10%** over the next 6 months through targeted interventions.\n"

    "##  2. Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we aim to familiarize ourselves with the dataset by understanding its structure, data types, volume, completeness, and general properties. This is a crucial foundation before cleaning, exploring, and modeling the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand the shape and structure of the data\n",
    "- Identify the target and feature variables\n",
    "- Assess data types (categorical, numerical, etc.)\n",
    "- Check for missing, duplicate, or inconsistent values\n",
    "- Begin identifying potential relationships and patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Dataset Overview:\n",
    "The dataset used in this project contains customer-level information for a telecommunications company. Each row represents a unique customer and includes attributes such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demographics** (e.g., gender, senior citizen, partner, dependents)  \n",
    "- **Account Information** (e.g., contract type, tenure, monthly charges)  \n",
    "- **Service Usage** (e.g., internet service, streaming services, tech support)  \n",
    "- **Churn Label** – whether the customer has churned (`Yes`/`No`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "###  Importance of this Step:\n",
    "A clear understanding of the raw data helps prevent poor assumptions and guides how we clean, explore, and model the data. Without proper understanding:\n",
    "- We may misinterpret features  \n",
    "- Miss important insights  \n",
    "- Or introduce bias into the model  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will load the dataset and begin our initial inspection.\n"
